// i would like to get the board set up first
// then move to making the blocks highlight 
// make them clickable next
// try to set the color for both sides or X and O would be ideal
// then make the already clicked blocks, unclickable 
// have the computer take the next turn
// create win conditions (
//   something like "if then then")
// an alert that pops up once you win, lose or tie (would that also be another set of "if then then")
// reset button after winning or losing or tying 
// and a counter to keep track of the score (player: "#", computer: "#", ties:"#")
// come on we got this!!!!
// Questions: could we make the div blocks buttons that change color after every turn?
